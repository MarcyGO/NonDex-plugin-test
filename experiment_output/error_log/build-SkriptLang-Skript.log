         > No matching variant of io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.19.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT:20230127.210711-79 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally but:
             - Variant 'apiElements' capability io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.19.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
                 - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11
                 - Other compatible attribute:
                     - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
             - Variant 'javadocElements' capability io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.19.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
                 - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
                 - Other compatible attributes:
                     - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
                     - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                     - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
             - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.19.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
                 - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
