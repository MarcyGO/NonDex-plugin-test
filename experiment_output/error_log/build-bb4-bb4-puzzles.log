* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'bb4-puzzles'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not resolve com.barrybecker4:bb4-gradle:1.8-SNAPSHOT.
     Required by:
         project :
      > No matching variant of com.barrybecker4:bb4-gradle:1.8-SNAPSHOT:20230129.165414-12 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.3' but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability com.barrybecker4:bb4-gradle:1.8-SNAPSHOT declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 19 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.3')
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability com.barrybecker4:bb4-gradle:1.8-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 19 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.3')
