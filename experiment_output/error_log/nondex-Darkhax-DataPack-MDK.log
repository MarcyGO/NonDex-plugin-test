* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve net.minecraftforge:javafmllanguage:1.17.1-37.0.109.
     Required by:
         project :
      > No matching variant of net.minecraftforge:javafmllanguage:1.17.1-37.0.109 was found. The consumer was configured to find an API of a library compatible with Java 11, preferably in the form of class files, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability net.minecraftforge:javafmllanguage:1.17.1-37.0.109 declares an API of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 16 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability net.minecraftforge:javafmllanguage:1.17.1-37.0.109 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 16 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
