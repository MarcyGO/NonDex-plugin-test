      > No matching variant of io.github.lucasstarsz.fastj:fastj-library:1.7.0-SNAPSHOT-1 was found. The consumer was configured to find an API of a library compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability io.github.lucasstarsz.fastj:fastj-library:1.7.0-SNAPSHOT-1 declares an API of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 18 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
          - Variant 'javadocElements' capability io.github.lucasstarsz.fastj:fastj-library:1.7.0-SNAPSHOT-1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
              - Other compatible attributes:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability io.github.lucasstarsz.fastj:fastj-library:1.7.0-SNAPSHOT-1 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
