FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/mnt/batch/tasks/workitems/NONDEX_nondex_r131_1M31d16h48m2s/job-1/Task566/wd/NonDex-plugin-test/github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app/build.gradle' line: 9

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'ods-provisioning-app'.
> property 'no_nexus' is set to false, but neither 'nexus_url', 'nexus_user' nor 'nexus_pw' is configured. You can do so by e.g. creating a gradle.properties file in your 'GRADLE_USER_HOME' (by default '~/.gradle') folder and setting the nexus properties there.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.
