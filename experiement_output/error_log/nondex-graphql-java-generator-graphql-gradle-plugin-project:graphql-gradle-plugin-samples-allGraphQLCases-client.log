FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':graphql-gradle-plugin-samples-allGraphQLCases-client:generateClientCodeForum' (type 'GraphQLGenerateCodeTask').
  - In plugin 'com.graphql_java_generator.graphql-gradle-plugin' type 'com.graphql_java_generator.gradleplugin.GraphQLGenerateCodeTask' property 'schemaFileFolder' specifies directory '/src/graphqls/forum' which doesn't exist.
    
    Reason: An input file was expected to be present but it doesn't exist.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Make sure the directory exists before the task is called.
      2. Make sure that the task which produces the directory is declared as an input.
    
    Please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/7.3.1/userguide/validation_problems.html#input_file_does_not_exist for more details about this problem.
