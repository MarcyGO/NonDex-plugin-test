* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':sponge:compileJava'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':sponge:compileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
     Required by:
         project :sponge
      > No matching variant of org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT:20220519.171536-38 was found. The consumer was configured to find an API of a library compatible with Java 11, preferably in the form of class files, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT declares an API of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
          - Variant 'javadocElements' capability org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
              - Other compatible attributes:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them preferably in the form of class files)
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
          - Variant 'sourcesElements' capability org.spongepowered:spongeapi:9.0.0-SNAPSHOT declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library

                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
