* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':Common'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':Common:classpath'.
   > Could not resolve org.quiltmc:quilt-mappings-on-loom:4.2.0.
     Required by:
         project :Common > org.quiltmc.loom:org.quiltmc.loom.gradle.plugin:0.12.40 > org.quiltmc:loom:0.12.40
      > No matching variant of org.quiltmc:quilt-mappings-on-loom:4.2.0 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.4.2' but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.quiltmc:quilt-mappings-on-loom:4.2.0 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 16 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4.2')
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability org.quiltmc:quilt-mappings-on-loom:4.2.0 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 16 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4.2')
