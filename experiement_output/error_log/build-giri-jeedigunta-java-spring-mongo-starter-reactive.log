FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'SpringReactiveRESTApiServer'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not resolve org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1.
     Required by:
         project : > org.springframework.boot:org.springframework.boot.gradle.plugin:3.0.1
      > The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally. However we cannot choose between the following variants of org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1:
          - javadocElements
          - sourcesElements
        All of them match the consumer attributes:
          - Variant 'javadocElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Unmatched attributes:
                  - Provides documentation but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Provides javadocs but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
                  - Provides release status but the consumer didn't ask for it
          - Variant 'sourcesElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Unmatched attributes:
                  - Provides documentation but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Provides sources but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
                  - Provides release status but the consumer didn't ask for it
        The following variants were also considered but didn't match the requested attributes:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1 declares a component, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.0.1 declares a runtime of a component, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
