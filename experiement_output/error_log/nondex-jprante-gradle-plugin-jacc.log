* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileGroovy'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve org.xbib:jacc:2.2.0.
     Required by:
         project :
      > No matching variant of org.xbib:jacc:2.2.0 was found. The consumer was configured to find an API of a library compatible with Java 8, preferably not packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.xbib:jacc:2.2.0 declares an API of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 8
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability org.xbib:jacc:2.2.0 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 8
