FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'htmlSanityCheckConsumer'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not resolve org.aim42:htmlSanityCheck:1.1.4.
     Required by:
         project :
      > No matching variant of org.aim42:htmlSanityCheck:1.1.4 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability org.aim42:htmlSanityCheck:1.1.4 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 14 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 11
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability org.aim42:htmlSanityCheck:1.1.4 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 14 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 11
